# Primes Up To a Million

- A curious question is, how many primes are there up to a million? To find out I first constructed an algorithm that checks if a number is prime. I Then iterated through the naturals up to one million checking each number and appending the primes in a list. 

- I provided a visual so the user can see the distribution of primes up to ten thousand. The scatterplot's dictated by Euler's equation z = r⋅e^iθ. Starting at zero it iterates up to ten thousand. After every iteration it increaes r and θ by a small amount which creates a spiral pattern starting at the origin. Yellow dots for primes, black dots for composites.
