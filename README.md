# Primes To a Million

- A curious question is, how many primes are there up to a million? To find out I first constructed an algorithm that checks if a number is prime. I Then iterated up to a million checking each number; appending all the primes in a list. 

- I provided a visual so the user can see the distribution of primes up to ten thousand. The scatterplot is dictated by Euler's equation z = r⋅e^iθ. After every iteration it increaes r and θ by a small amount which creates a spiral pattern starting from the origin. The yellow dots represent primes, and the gaps represent the composites.
