# Primes To a Million

- A curious question is, "how many primes are there up to a million?". To find out I constructed an algorithm that checks if a number is prime. I then iterated up to a million checking each number to find the answer. 

- I have provided a graphical depiciton of the set of primes dictated by Euler's equation z = r⋅e^iθ. The yellow dots represent the primes and the gaps represent the composites.

- Ulam's Spiral is a graphical depiction of the set of primes developed by Stainslaw Ulam in 1963. The mysterious gaps seem to imply that the primes are distributed by some underlying structure, not randomness.
