# Primes To a Million

- A curious question is, how many primes are there up to a million? To find out I first constructed an algorithm that checks if a number is prime. I Then iterated up to a million checking each number; appending all the primes in a list. 

- Ulam's Spiral is a graphical depiction of the set of primes developed by Stainslaw Ulam in 1963. The mysterious gaps imply the primes seem to be distributed by some underlying structure, not randomness.

- I have also provided my own graphical depiciton of the set of primes dictated by Euler's equation z = r⋅e^iθ. The yellow dots represent the primes and the gaps represent the composites.
